# Marp Inline Preview for Obsidian

Render [Marp](https://marp.app/) slide decks directly inside Obsidian — inline beneath each `---` slide separator while editing, and as the full deck in reading mode. Works on desktop and mobile.

| Mode | What you see |
| --- | --- |
| **Edit / Live Preview** | A rendered slide widget appears under each slide break. Updates as you type, with a configurable debounce. |
| **Reading** | The entire page is replaced by the rendered Marp deck. |

Only files whose YAML frontmatter contains `marp: true` are touched. Everything else renders as ordinary Markdown.

## Features

- Marp Core 4 under the hood — same renderer as the official Marp tooling, in pure JavaScript so it works on Obsidian Mobile (iOS & Android).
- Zero-external-dependency PDF export on desktop — exports vector PDFs with slide dimensions, optional presenter note annotations, and configurable image DPI downsampling without requiring Chrome or external CLI tools.
- Custom theme support through `.marprc.yml` (vault-root, with a fallback to the slide file's folder), plus the standard frontmatter `theme:` directive.
- KaTeX math is bundled — no network roundtrips, no broken formulae offline.
- Marp's per-slide CSS is mounted inside Shadow DOM, so it can't leak into Obsidian's own UI.
- Pluggable: toggle the edit-mode preview, reading-mode preview, math support, and debounce interval from Settings.

## Quick start

```yaml
---
marp: true
theme: default
---

# My deck

- Slide one

---

## Slide two

That's it.
```

Save the file. Switch between edit and reading mode to see the previews.

## Custom themes via `.marprc.yml`

Place a `.marprc.yml` at the vault root (preferred) or next to your slide file:

```yaml
themeSet:
  - themes/my-theme.css
theme: my-theme
```

Each entry in `themeSet` is a vault-relative path resolved against the `.marprc.yml` location. The plugin reads those CSS files via the Obsidian Vault API (no Node `fs`), so it works on mobile too. Your CSS must have a header comment such as `/* @theme my-theme */` to be selectable by name.

Slides can opt in per-file via frontmatter:

```yaml
---
marp: true
theme: my-theme
---
```

## Export to PDF

You can export your presentation slides to a clean vector PDF directly inside Obsidian Desktop without installing Google Chrome or external tools:

1. Open a slide file with `marp: true` in its frontmatter.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and select **Marp: Export slide deck to PDF...** (or right-click the note in the file explorer and choose **Export Marp to PDF...**).
3. Configure your export options:
   - **Output file path**: Vault-relative path for the exported `.pdf` file (defaults to `<note-name>.pdf`).
   - **Image quality / DPI**:
     - *Original*: No downsampling or re-compression.
     - *High (~300 DPI, 4K max)*: High-resolution output for physical printing.
     - *Medium (~150 DPI, 1080p max)*: Recommended balance for digital presentations and email (reduces file size by 70–90% for photo-heavy decks).
     - *Low (~96 DPI, 720p max)*: Smallest file size.
   - **Include presenter notes**: Embeds speaker notes (HTML comments `<!-- ... -->`) as standard PDF sticky note annotations on each slide page, matching `marp-cli --pdf-notes`.
   - **Open after export**: Opens the generated PDF in Obsidian upon completion.
4. Click **Export**.

## Settings

### Preview & Math
- **Inline preview in edit mode** — toggle the CodeMirror widget.
- **Full preview in reading mode** — toggle the deck render.
- **Math rendering** — `KaTeX` (bundled) or `Off`.

### PDF Export
- **Include presenter notes** — default toggle for embedding speaker note annotations.
- **Open PDF after export** — default toggle for auto-opening exported PDFs.
- **Default image quality / DPI** — default raster image downsampling preset (`Original`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`).

### Commands
- `Marp Inline Preview: Refresh Marp previews` — forces a full reload of previews and themes.
- `Marp: Export slide deck to PDF...` — opens the PDF export dialog for the active Marp note.

## Install: build locally and copy into another vault

The plugin ships as three files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`). You build them once in this repo, then drop them into any vault.

### 1. Build the plugin

Requires Node.js 18 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/obsidian-marp-inline-preview-plugin.git
cd obsidian-marp-inline-preview-plugin
npm install
npm run build
```

After `npm run build` the repo root contains:

```
main.js        # bundled plugin code (~1.9 MB, includes Marp Core + KaTeX)
manifest.json  # plugin metadata (checked in)
styles.css     # host-side styles (checked in)
```

### 2. Find the target vault's plugin folder

Inside your Obsidian vault there is a hidden `.obsidian/` directory. Plugins live under `.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`. For this plugin the folder is `marp-inline-preview`.

Typical full paths:

| OS | Example path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `/path/to/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/marp-inline-preview/` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\you\Documents\MyVault\.obsidian\plugins\marp-inline-preview\` |
| iOS | `On My iPhone → Obsidian → MyVault → .obsidian → plugins → marp-inline-preview` (Files.app, "Show Hidden Files" on) |
| Android | `/storage/emulated/0/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/marp-inline-preview/` (any file manager) |

Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet.

### 3. Copy the three files

From the repo root, with `TARGET_VAULT` set to your vault directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
TARGET_VAULT="/path/to/MyVault"
mkdir -p "$TARGET_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/marp-inline-preview"
cp main.js manifest.json styles.css "$TARGET_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/marp-inline-preview/"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$TARGET_VAULT = "C:\Users\you\Documents\MyVault"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$TARGET_VAULT\.obsidian\plugins\marp-inline-preview" | Out-Null
Copy-Item main.js, manifest.json, styles.css "$TARGET_VAULT\.obsidian\plugins\marp-inline-preview\"
```

On mobile, sync the three files via iCloud / Obsidian Sync / a USB transfer to the same path. Obsidian Sync replicates `.obsidian/plugins/` automatically if you enable it.

### 4. Enable it in Obsidian

1. Open the target vault.
2. **Settings → Community plugins**. If you see "Restricted mode", turn it off.
3. Reload the plugin list (the circular-arrow icon next to "Installed plugins"), or run **Reload app without saving** from the command palette.
4. Toggle **Marp Inline Preview** on.

Open a markdown file with `marp: true` in its frontmatter — you should see slide widgets in edit mode and the full deck in reading mode.

### Updating

Re-run `npm run build`, then re-copy the same three files (step 3) and reload Obsidian.

### Uninstalling

Disable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins, then delete `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/marp-inline-preview/`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:vault    # symlinks build outputs into test-vault/ and starts esbuild watch
```

Then in Obsidian: `File → Open vault…` and pick the `test-vault/` folder in this repo. Enable the plugin and open one of the files in `slides/`.

`npm run build` produces a production bundle (~1.9 MB).

## Mobile notes

- Everything goes through `app.vault.adapter` — no Node `fs`, no Electron-only APIs.
- `mathjax-full` is aliased out at bundle time so the plugin stays small.
- KaTeX fonts are loaded from the bundle, not a CDN. Math works offline.
- Twemoji is disabled; OS Unicode emoji are used instead, so no CDN fetch.

## TODO: Marp CLI parity

- Rewrite relative URLs emitted in inline styles, especially Marp background images such as `![bg](...)`. Marp Core renders these as `background-image:url(...)`, while the current Obsidian preview only rewrites `<img src="...">`, so images that work in Marp CLI can disappear inside the iframe.
- Size preview iframes from each rendered SVG's `viewBox` instead of assuming Marp's default 1280x720 slide. Decks using `size: 4:3` or custom theme `@size` rules can currently be clipped or shown with the wrong aspect ratio compared with Marp CLI output.
- Rework theme reloads so modified custom theme CSS replaces the existing Marp Core theme registration. The current cache invalidation re-reads CSS, but Marp Core may keep the first registered theme with the same name, leaving edit/reading previews stale after theme edits.
- Include rendered CSS or a theme revision in the reading-mode render hash. At the moment the hash is based on markdown plus theme name, so a CSS-only theme update can be skipped even after requesting a reading preview rerender.
- Decide how much of `.marprc.yml` CLI configuration should be supported beyond `theme` and `themeSet`. Options such as `html`, `math`, and other Marp CLI/Core settings can make the plugin preview differ from `marp` command output.
- Preserve query strings and fragments when rewriting local resource URLs. Paths like `image.svg#fragment` or `image.png?cache=...` are resolved by stripping the suffix today, which can change rendered output versus Marp CLI.

## Limitations / known issues

- **Mermaid** isn't supported — Marp Core itself doesn't ship Mermaid integration.
- Reading-mode rendering replaces the preview section wholesale, so plugins that mutate that section (e.g. some outline plugins) may not work on Marp files.
- The CodeMirror plugin uses `editor.cm` to associate a `ViewPlugin` with the active `TFile`; this is an internal property and could break in a future Obsidian release.
